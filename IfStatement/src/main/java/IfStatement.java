    /**
     * An if statement uses a conditional statement (within parentheses) to determine if the code
     * within {curly braces} should run.
     * If statements can be coupled with an else{} statement or else if(){} statement.
     *
     * Let's make an if statement that does the following:
     * if bool is true, return x.
     * if bool is false, return y.
